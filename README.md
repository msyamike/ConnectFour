# ConnectFour

In this project you will implement the classic game of Connect Four. This is a somewhat simple game to understand and play which should allow you to focus on learning GUI

It is a two player game where each player takes a turn dropping a checker into a slot (one of the columns) on the game board. That checker will fall down the column and either land on
top of another checker or land on the bottom row. To win the game, a player needs to get 4 of their checkers in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row before the other player
